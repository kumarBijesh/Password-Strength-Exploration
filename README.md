 Password Strength Exploration

Hey there!  
This little project is all about understanding **how to create strong passwords** and why it matters.  
It's a simple exercise, but it teaches a lot about keeping your online accounts safe.



üöÄ What did I do?
 I came up with **multiple passwords** ranging from weak to very strong.  
 I used [passwordmeter.com](https://www.passwordmeter.com/) to check how strong each password was.  
 I took screenshots of the results to see what makes a password strong or weak.



 üìù Screenshots of my tests

1. **Very Weak Password Example:

2. Still Weak (only letters):
   ![Letters Only](./Screenshot%202025-07-01%20104010.png)

3. Only Numbers (weak):

4. Very Strong Password:

 What did I learn?

- Passwords become **stronger** when they have:
  - A mix of **uppercase & lowercase letters**
  - **Numbers**
  - **Symbols** like `@#$%`
  - More **length** (longer passwords are harder to crack)

- Passwords are **weaker** if they:
  - Use only letters or only numbers
  - Have repeated or sequential characters like `12345` or `abcdef`
  - Are short (less than 8 characters)



 Common attacks to watch out for

Brute Force:** tries every possible combination.
Dictionary Attacks:** tries words from a dictionary or common passwords list.


 Tips for better passwords

 Use at least **12+ characters**.  
 Mix **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.  
 Avoid names, dates, or easy-to-guess words.  
 Use a **password manager** to create & store long, unique passwords.


 Final thoughts

By just spending a few minutes testing passwords, I saw how much more secure they can become.  
It's a small habit that makes a huge difference in keeping your data safe.


Stay secure!
